TAT-pulsar Validations
======================
Alright, this section is the testing and validation part of our Python package - the magic behind our pulsar timing analysis tool. Here, we're going to show you how we put our code through the wringer to make sure it's up to snuff.

We didn't just test our algorithms (though we totally did that too), but we also ran a bunch of simulations to make sure our package is as dependable and precise as we say it is. Weâ€™re talking everything from close-up checks of each function to wider simulations that test the whole shebang in different scenarios.

So strap in, and get ready to dive into the behind-the-scenes action of our Python package. We promise it'll give you a whole new appreciation for what goes into creating a dependable and accurate tool for all you pulsar timing analysis enthusiasts out there.
